            <li>
                <p>
                    Avoid lengthier C# code lines to add the MVC bundles.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Organize the MVC bundles like views, scripts, and css folders.

        <h2>Suggestions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Do not have many bundles. This may add additional overhead of maintaining it.</p>

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The changes made to the bundle files will not be auto-refreshed without restarting the web application.
                    This auto-refresh MVC bundles on bundle file change feature is not implemented since implementing this feature requires using file-watcher and doing this refreshing job in background. Doing so may result in unpredictable effects.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                For example,
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The refreshed/updated bundle may be in use for a current request. Updating it will require the bundle to be removed and re-added to the MVC bundle table.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        IIS may go for sleep when there are no more active requests for certain amount of time. The background thread which does this file-watch and updating the MVC bundle may also go for sleep or killed by IIS.

                </ul>
